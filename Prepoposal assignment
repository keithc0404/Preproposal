## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Mainly I want to do a card game and have a few ideas I like. 
Acey Deucey is one card game I would think would be a good idea to do. 
Consists of getting dealt two cards and wagering whether the next card is in 
between the two cards and being dealt the same as the two results in a loss.
Variation of duecey maybe consisting of point system.
Another card game I think would be nice is horses.
Consists where you have all four suits lined out and flip a random card and the suit
determines which horse, or suit, moves forward in the game. 
Variation of horses can be easily attainable.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work on this alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not currently at this time.
